# Popular Movies - stage 2

## Goal

Expand on the movies app you built in Project 1 to create a fully-featured app. In this project, you’ll allow users to view and play trailers, read reviews, and mark their favorite movies. You’ll also create a database and content provider to store and handle your app data.

## Libraries

- Butterknife
- Picasso
- Volley

## Note

To run the app you need an API key from themoviedb.org, more about it at the beginning of MainActivity.java.
